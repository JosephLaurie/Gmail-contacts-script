# Gmail-contacts-script
My dad wanted to find all the email contacts he had sent messages to in the last year, from gmail, for a mailing list. Gmail has no function to export emails or select them from a folder. 
I found a solution using google cloud controls to make an API and use this to parse the emails from the last year in his sent folder.
I then extract the email addresses, and export them as a CSV so he can upload this to his mailing list provider.
